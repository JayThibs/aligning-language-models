        "After running some further tests on GPT-2 and GPT-J, I’ve decided that the task will be question-answering. However, it will be in the form of a question someone might ask on a forum like LessWrong (though not necessarily on that forum only). By that I mean that most questions will not be as simple and easy-to-answer as “What is the capital of France?” and it will have some extra sentences surrounding the question so that model needs to parse that there is a question to answer. This will likely involve a mix of manually creating my own question-answer pair and grabbing as many as it makes sense from sites like LessWrong.\n",
        "\n",
        "## The Alignment Criteria\n",
        "\n",
        "For the alignment criteria, the goal is that the model is at least trying to answer the question instead of outputting gibberish or some kind of text that is irrelevant to the question. This type of criteria relates to Paul Christiano’s Intent Alignment, where the model is at least trying to do the thing we want it to do. In other words, the model can still “pass” if it produces as bad answer, as long as it’s trying to answer the question.\n",
        "\n",
        "Since we are not at AGI levels, GPT-2 will likely fail to try to answer questions because it lacks the capability to parse the question and understand that there is a question to answer. It won’t be because it’s trying to avoid what we want it to do."

        "If we look at both cases, we can see that the GPU is faster. When we only generated 1 completion each, the GPU was about 1.5 times faster than the CPU. When we generated 10 completions each, the GPU was about 4.45 times faster than the CPU. The length of time is took the GPU to do 10 completions is not much longer than when it did only 1 completion. That is because the GPU can do inference in parallel and it is basically as slow as its slowest sequence it generated.\n",
