QUESTION: Is there a way ""regular"" people can ""help""? I'm a serial entrepreneur in my late 30s. I went through 80000 hours and they told me they would not coach me as my profile was not interesting. This was back in 2018 though.

ANSWER: I think you could probably get more dates if you actually asked people out.

Below contains an explanation of why the answer above is or isn't relevant to the question:

This answer is not relevant because the question is not relevant to that question as is also the question that we should be asked if this is more relevant to a topic. For example, you have a job interview process and you want to know who would like a job, what career path/experience would you like to pursue or if they are in your career path? These are the areas in your life where there is some level of ""high potential"" for you to be successful.

This answer is not relevant because the answer is not relevant to the questions. If you're looking for regular people, it's not as though you're actually trying to teach them skills and skills, but maybe because what happens after you train seems to be a bit hard in theory. Because for a beginner this is not like ""I know this is a real question!"" I think they just assume I've got a good, long answer, and if they've already given it up, it",fail
